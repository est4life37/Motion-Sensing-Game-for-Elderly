The initial version of this game was created at the "Youth Innovation for Senior Citizens" Game Development Hackathon held by CityUHK, with a period of three days.

As the aging of the population intensifies in China, how to help the elderlly maintain health and vitality has become an important issue. As an emerging form of game, motion-sensing games operate by detecting the player's physical movements. They enable the elderly to engage in physical activity while playing, which not only exercises their bodies but also provises entertainment and social connections with others. Therefore, designed with a clean interface and simple interaction logic, the game aims to fit the elderly's usage habits.

The game was developed using Python libraries such as [Pygame](https://pypi.org/project/pygame/) , [OpenCV](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/) and [Mediapipe](https://pypi.org/project/mediapipe/) It uses [OpenCV](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/) to process camera images and capture human movements, then renders the content through a [Pygame](https://pypi.org/project/pygame/) window.

The initial version contains three major parts. The first part is the entry interface, where players can access the corresponding game interface by grabbing a certain number of items. The game interface is further divided into two parts: one is the table tennis game, and the other is traditional Chinese medicine game.
